      <h1>Jessica's Blog</h1>
      <p> I'm Jessica, and I'm a 3rd Year Web Development student. I love corgis a lot to the point where my friends have to stop me from talking about corgis.
        I like reading and writing fiction, and recently I have been doing vector art based on my friends' pictures. </p>

        <h2>Food</h2>
        <p>I like sweet foods a lot! I can't handle bitter food, but aside from that, I would eat anything! Sadly, I have to budget my money wisely nowadays especially since prices are going up.</p>

        <h2>Public transportation</h2>
        <p>My most favorite way of going to and from school is taking the bus. It's cheap and I have more time to sleep while travelling. Sometimes it's inconvenient since there's no space to sit on, but I'd rather have that than face MRT during rush hour.</p>

          <h2>Vector Corgi</h2>
          <p>I spent over a day of making that vector corgi in the front page. I would make more improvements about it soon enough, just not now.</p>

          <h2>Hi Welcome to Chili's</h2>
          <p>People I frequently talk to are already office workers, so it's rare to see them go invite everyone to go out and a lot of us agreed to go. Around this week, I'll go to Chili's with them. I hope that the day will end well.</p>

          <h2>School</h2>
          <p>My school is considered to be one of the more laid back colleges. Being a student here for over 3 years, I can say that it's a good place to study. It just gets awkward when people chat with me and start saying about me being lucky in here. I also met a lot of really nice people here, and more or less improved.</p>

          <h2>Supergiant Games</h2>
          <p>I love Supergiant games. I've already tried out their 3 games, and I love Transistor the best. They all have a great soundtrack, great art and a really nice story.</p>

          <h2>Cousin</h2>
          <p>I love my cousin a lot so I made two vector arts based off of her.</p>

          <p>I like Pie a lot. I've been pulling this off for so long until recently.</p>
